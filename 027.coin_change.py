# Given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. From that, you need to write a function to compute the fewest 
# number of coins that you need to make up that amount, and which combination of coins is needed to make up the amount. If you canâ€™t reach the given amount 
# of money with any combination of the coins, you return -1. 
# Solve it with bottom-up dynamic programming with tabularization solution in Python. Comment for the time and space complexity of your suggested solution.
#
# Time complexity: O(amount * len(coins)), as we iterate through the coins and 
# the target amount.
# Space complexity: O(amount+1), as we use a table to store the fewest number of 
# coins needed for each amount.
